# Week 8: pytest Advanced

## Week 8 Goal
By end of this week, you will:
- Implement fixtures for efficient test setup and teardown
- Understand fixture scopes to optimize test performance
- Use parametrization to run tests with diverse datasets
- Organize shared fixtures using conftest.py
- Use markers to categorize and control test execution
- Build parametrized-test-suite (Mini-project)
- Push your eighth deliverable to GitHub

- When to use each scope for LLM testing
- Performance implications of scopes
- **Time:** 1 hour

### File 3: `practice/03_parametrization.py`
**Covers:**
- Running one test with many inputs
- Testing boundary conditions efficiently
- Fixture-level parametrization
- **Time:** 1 hour

### File 4: `practice/04_conftest_markers.py`
**Covers:**
- Global fixtures in conftest.py
- Using markers to skip or group tests
- Registering custom markers in pytest.ini
- **Time:** 1 hour

# LEARNING TRACK

## Monday: Introduction to Fixtures (1 hour)

### Watch These Videos
1. **Software Testing Mentor: Pytest Fixtures**
   - URL: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yA5jqNCCOLE
   - Why: Learn how to manage test state properly.

### Practice Exercises

## Tuesday: Fixture Scopes (1 hour)

### Practice Exercises
Run `week8/practice/02_fixture_scopes.py`.

## Wednesday: Parametrization (1 hour)

### Practice Exercises

## Thursday: Markers & conftest (1 hour)

### Practice Exercises
Run `week8/practice/04_conftest_markers.py`.

## Friday: Integration (1 hour)

Review how to build a scalable test architecture using everything learned in Phase 0.

## Week 8 Deliverables

## Saturday-Sunday: Build `parametrized-test-suite`

**Mini-Project: `parametrized-test-suite`**

### Why this matters in AI testing?
LLMs handle infinitely variable inputs. You cannot write a separate test for every possible prompt. You must use parametrization to test hundreds of inputs reliably and fixtures to manage the setup of different model configurations.

### Learning Focus
- Advanced fixture patterns for model setup
- Massively parametrized tests for prompt evaluation
- Organized test structure using conftest.py
- Using markers to separate fast unit tests from slow model calls

### Mini-Project Overview
**An advanced, scalable test suite for evaluating LLM responses across multiple scenarios.**
